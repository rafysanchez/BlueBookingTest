Dear Developer,
We ask all our candidates to complete a small development test as part of our evaluation process.

Functional Requirements:

Create a small web application that allows users to:

Login
View a list of contacts, where each contact has a name and a phone number
Add, edit, and delete contacts
Logout
Develop the backend API and database required for the application to function.

Be prepared to showcase the working application and discuss the source code (including the database) during the interview.

Non-Functional Requirements:

Preferably use Angular for the front end, C# for the back end, and MySQL/PostgreSQL for the database.
Please respond with your estimated completion date for the application, and we will schedule an interview with you.
